# Black-Friday-Sales-EDA
Black Friday Sales EDA is my another Data Science EDA project, this project consists of dynamic null value processing on the basis of certain criteria derived from the data which was already available to me unlike Zomato EDA where I simply dropped the records containing null values.
It includes data pre-processing followed by data visualization using Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib.
